for row in soup.find_all('tbody')[3].find_all('tr'):
    col = row.find_all('td')


This code is using the BeautifulSoup library to scrape an HTML page. soup.find_all('tbody')[3] finds the fourth <tbody> element in the page, and .find_all('tr') finds all of the <tr> (table row) elements within that <tbody> element.

The code then uses a for loop to iterate through each row (for row in soup.find_all('tbody')[3].find_all('tr')) and for each row it is using the .find_all('td') method to find all of the <td> (table data) elements within that row. It is storing the resulting list of <td> elements in the variable col.

It is helpful to know the structure of the HTML page you are trying to scrape, since the way the data is organized on the page will determine how to navigate to it using BeautifulSoup.

It is important to note that the soup.find_all('tbody')[3] is searching for fourth table body but it may not be exist in some cases then the execution will be stopped with an IndexError
It would be better to use try-except block to solve such problems.
